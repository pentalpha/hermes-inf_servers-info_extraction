# Testing Environment for Information Extraction from Emergency Call Transcriptions

## 1. Run the benchmarks

The following sequence of commands will install the required packages, load a specialized dataset from HF and make inferences with several models.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python dataset_loading.py
python testing.py results/gli_results.json
```

### 1.1. NuExtract

NuExtract needs a different environment for testing, which is a VLLM-based docker container

```sh
chmod +x nuextract/*.sh
cd nuextract && ./build_nuextract.sh
```

Then, run the container for NuExtract-2.0-2B:

```sh
./nuextract/up2b.sh
```
After the server is functioning, you can test this model.
```sh
python test_nuextract.py results/nuextract_results.json numind/NuExtract-2.0-2B
```

Now, do the same for 4B model.
```sh
./nuextract/up4b.sh
```

```sh
python test_nuextract.py results/nuextract_results.json numind/NuExtract-2.0-4B
```

## 2. Parse Results

```sh
python make_df.py results/nuextract_results.json results/gli_results.json
```
